# Deployment Guidelines

This project is designed to run on an EC2 instance with automated daily updates.

## EC2 Setup Requirements
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git for repository updates
- Python virtual environment
- Proper environment variables configured
- Cron job for daily execution

## Deployment Process
1. Clone repository to EC2 instance
2. Create and activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure
5. Run deployment script: [scripts/deploy.sh](mdc:scripts/deploy.sh)
6. Verify cron job installation

## Environment Variables
Required variables in `.env`:
```
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=  # Perplexity AI API key
EMAIL_FROM=          # Sender email address
EMAIL_TO=            # Comma-separated recipient emails
EMAIL_PASSWORD=      # Email service password
```

## Logging
- All operations are logged to `/var/log/newsletter.log`
- Using Python's logging module with rotation
- Errors are logged with timestamps and context
- Log rotation handled by RotatingFileHandler

## Maintenance
- Daily git pull for latest code
- Automatic dependency updates via pip
- Error notifications via email
- Regular log rotation
- Virtual environment management

## Monitoring
- Use supervisor or systemd for process management
- Monitor Python process health
- Track memory usage
- Monitor disk space for logs
